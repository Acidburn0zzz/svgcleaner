# How to Contribute

## New ideas

New ideas about how to make SVG files smaller are always welcome.
No need to implement them, though. Just create an issue on GitHub that explains your idea(s).

## Broken image

If you found that `svgcleaner` broke your image, firstly open them (original and cleaned) in
Google Chrome, since it has a very good support of the SVG, unlike many other applications.

- If images are still renders differently - then they probably broken.
Create an issue on GitHub with your image attached to it.
- If images are rendered the same - then there are some problems with your rendering
application/editor. Such cases are not treated as errors, but you still can open an issue.

## Other

- English grammar fixes are extremely welcome.

If you don't have a GitHub account you can send an email to: svgcleanerteam@gmail.com
