Generally, SVG files produced by vector editors contain a lot of unused elements and attributes that just blow up their size, but not add quality. SVG Cleaner could help you to clean up your SVG files from unnecessary data. It works in batch mode and basically does two things:
 - removing elements and attributes that don't contribute to the final rendering;
 - making those elements and attributes that are actually used more compact.
The app has a lot of options for cleanup and optimization and provides multithreaded file processing on the multicore processors.

Usually, images cleaned by SVG Cleaner may be as small as 10-60% of the original sizes. Important! Internal image viewer in SVG Cleaner uses QtSvg for rendering SVG images. Since Qt supports only the static features of SVG 1.2 Tiny that imposes a number of restrictions on rendering of advanced features. For instance, elements such as clipPath, mask, filters etc. will not be rendered at all.
