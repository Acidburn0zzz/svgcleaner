Join presentational attributes
------------------------------

SVG presentation attributes can be set via separated attributes and via ``style`` attribute.
If we have less than 5 presentation attributes - it's better to store them separately.
Otherwise ``style`` is shorter.

.. There is no example, because a style with 5 attributes will be a huge, nonbreakable line,
.. which will break the layout.
